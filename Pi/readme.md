The brains of the game. This module includes game logic, reading the joysticks, sending serial messages to varioud Arduino modules (RFID stations, Zumos), etc..

## Discussion

Joystick input could be implemented using the pygame API, joystick module.

Pygame may also be a useful GUI tool? Its only issue is that it is fiddly to install, can't just use pip.
